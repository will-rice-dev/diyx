# Angular Review

I am getting back into coding with Angular. This is for a job interview that specifically requires this Angular knowledge:

"(Angular with RxJS, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, micro frontend)"

I have made a small back end server, you can see the API docs for it in @api-docs.json

Can you create an Angular front end that uses this API and highlights the needed skills mentioned above?
